# MetroProject
A project presenting a concurrently functioning metro.

In this model there are 3 trains. Each train has a designated route, which it follows from one end to another in a loop.

Our goal is to ensure non of the trains collide on their way.


This program uses java locks and conditions to achieve that, implementing a variation of the five philosophers problem.
